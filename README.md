A forcing artifact. A love letter. A fossil record.

What This Is
143 tracks curated by da5ch0 (sorta). The sequence is intentional. The clusters are phases. The resonances (⟡) are orbital companions — ghost tracks that hover near the main sequence. Listen in order. She's talking.

How to Build a Spotify Playlist Without a Spotify Account
The repo maintainer doesn't need Spotify for this to work. Anyone with a free Spotify account can:

Go to TuneMyMusic.com
Select "Text" as source
Paste the contents of sarima_import.txt
Select Spotify (or any platform) as destination
Log in with their own account
Done — full 143-track playlist, correct order

Alternatively: open sarima_spotify.md and click through. Each link is a direct Spotify search. The top result is almost always correct.
Notes on Coverage
Some nerdcore and indie tracks (MC Frontalot, Dual Core, YTCracker, Beefy, Captain Dan and the Scurvy Crew, Dale Chase, Great Scott, etc.) may have limited or no Spotify availability. The YouTube edition has the best coverage for these. Both editions are canonical. Use whichever your platform supports; use both if you want the full picture.
The Count
143 tracks. 27 resonances.
